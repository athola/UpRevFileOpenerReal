Font Files Directory
====================

This directory should contain the OpenSans font files:
- OpenSans-Regular.ttf
- OpenSans-Semibold.ttf

These fonts are referenced in MauiProgram.cs and are used throughout the application.

You can download these fonts from Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans

Alternatively, you can use any other fonts by:
1. Adding the .ttf files to this directory
2. Updating the font registration in MauiProgram.cs
